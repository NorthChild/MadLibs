# MadLibs
a collection of changable MadLib stories 
this is the skeleton of the app, at the moment i'm concentrating on giving the option to choose the genre of the story.

# its still ongoing and will update as i go forward

# NEXT TO COME


- create different variables reppresenting different story types (sci fi, horror, comedy etc) that the user will be
able to choose from
- have multiple story types of the same genre and have them rotate as the user tries again
- ask for a topic and following words that will later be inserted inside the stories/scenarios
- save the user input as variables and then summon it inside the stories/scenarios
- print the result (original text with the variating words summoned using (f'')
- create a UI to display and potentially also make the UI dependent on the selected thematic

- add a random word generator for the words to be inserted
